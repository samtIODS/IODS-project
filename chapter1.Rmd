# Thoughts about the Course

Looking forward to learning some **R**. I have a decent bit of experience in programming and data science, but I have done almost nothing in **R** before so that should be interesting. To be honest, not a 100% sure if I'll have the time to finish the course but we'll see. I believe I found the course while browsing **WebOodi**.
